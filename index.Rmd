# Dependence and covariance

## Independence

- Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if knowing the value of one provides no information about the value of the other

- Formally, $X$ and $Y$ are independent when

  <div class="box">
  $$f_{Y|X}(y|x) = f_Y(y),$$
  </div>

  <!-- a condition which may also be stated as  -->

  <!-- $$f_{XY}(x,y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y)$$ -->

## Mean independence

- $Y$ is **mean independent** of $X$ if the conditional mean of $Y$ equal its unconditional mean; that is, if

  <div class="box">
  $$\mu_{Y|X} = \mu_Y$$
  </div>

- Mean independence is **weaker** than independence;

  that is, independence implies mean independence, but mean independence does not imply independence

<!-- - Mean independence is weaker than indepenence: independence implies mean independence, but mean independence does not imply independence -->

## Covariance

- The **covariance** is a common measure of the extent to which $X$ and $Y$ move together 

  <div class="box">
  $$\mathrm{cov}(X,Y) = \mathrm{E}[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)]$$
  </div>
  
- We sometimes refer to $\mathrm{cov}(X,Y)$ as $\sigma_{XY}$

- Zero covariance is weaker than mean independence;

  that is, mean independence implies zero covariance, but zero covariance does not imply mean independence

## Correlation

- The **correlation** is a closely related and **unit-free** measure of the extent to which $X$ and $Y$ move together 

  <div class="box">
  $$\mathrm{corr}(X,Y) = \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$$
  </div>

- We sometimes refer to $\mathrm{corr}(X,Y)$ as $\rho_{XY}$


# Summary

## Summary

- $X$ and $Y$ are independent if the conditional distributions coincide with the marginal distributions

- $Y$ is mean independent of $X$ if the conditional mean of $Y$ equal its unconditional mean

- The covariance between $X$ and $Y$ is is a measure of how closely $X$ and $Y$ move together 

- Independence $\Rightarrow$ Mean independence $\Rightarrow$ zero covariance

  Independence $\not \Leftarrow$ Mean independence $\not \Leftarrow$ zero covariance
